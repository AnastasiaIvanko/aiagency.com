                        <div class="text-one-copy">In today&#x27;s digital age, having an online presence is crucial for
                            success. Whether you&#x27;re a small business owner or a large corporation, a website can
                            help you reach your target audience and achieve your goals.</div>
                        <div class="text-b"><strong class="bold-text-4">24/7 Accessibility</strong>‚Äç</div>
                        <div class="text-c">Having a website provides businesses with the ability to be accessible to
                            potential customers 24/7, which can significantly increase their reach and sales.</div>
                        <div class="text-d">According to a study, 81% of people conduct online research before making a
                            purchase. This means that having a website is crucial for businesses to capture potential
                            customers during their research phase.</div>
                        <div class="text-e"><strong class="bold-text-5">Increased Credibility</strong></div>
                        <div class="text-f">In today&#x27;s digital age, having a website is essential for any business
                            looking to establish credibility with potential customers. A well-designed website not only
                            provides important information about the business, but it also shows that the business is
                            serious and professional about its online presence.</div>
                        <div class="text-g">Take, for example, a small local coffee shop that has a website showcasing
                            their menu, hours of operation, and location. This website not only makes it easier for
                            customers to find and visit the coffee shop, but it also gives the impression that the
                            coffee shop is a legitimate business you can trust.</div>
                        <div class="text-h"><strong class="bold-text-6">Marketing and Branding</strong></div>
                        <div class="text-i">A website is not just an online presence, but also a powerful marketing and
                            branding tool. It allows businesses to showcase their products and services in a visually
                            appealing way, while also providing valuable information to potential customers. By having a
                            well-designed website, businesses can attract and retain customers by offering them a unique
                            experience that sets them apart from competitors.</div>
                        <div class="textj">One example of a business that has successfully utilized their website for
                            marketing purposes is Nike. Their website not only showcases their products, but also
                            provides valuable content such as workout routines and training tips. This not only attracts
                            potential customers, but also helps to establish Nike as a reputable and knowledgeable brand
                            in the fitness industry. Another example is Coca-Cola, whose website features engaging
                            videos and interactive games that reinforce their brand image of happiness and positivity.
                            These examples demonstrate the power of a well-designed website in creating a strong brand
                            identity and attracting and retaining customers.</div>
                        <div class="text-k"><strong class="bold-text-7">Competitive Advantage</strong></div>
                        <div class="text-l">Having a website can give businesses a competitive advantage over those
                            without one. With the majority of consumers researching products and services online before
                            making a purchase, having a strong online presence is crucial to staying ahead of the
                            competition.</div>
                        <div class="text-m">One example of a business that gained a competitive edge through their
                            website is Warby Parker, an eyewear company. By offering an easy-to-use online shopping
                            experience with free shipping and returns, they were able to disrupt the traditional
                            brick-and-mortar eyewear industry and establish themselves as a leader in the market.</div>
